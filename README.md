## Summary

The goal of this Odin Project assignment was to utilize webpack, Javascript object constructors and user input data in order to create a better todo list.

It took me quite a time to finish this project but it all worthwhile, it has strengthen my knowledge in Objects and other useful array method such as Array.filter() and Array.find(). I also tried to follow SOLID principle and keep my code clean as much as possible.
